## General Info

The Hummingbird Hammocks Ultralight Single Hammock is the lightest weight, smallest packing hammock on the market. It weighs less than a lemon and packs smaller than a coffee cup, holds up to 300 pounds, and is designed by an FAA Certified Parachute Rigger. It brings parachute technology to the hammock industry for the first time. The Button Link attachment system contains no bulky or heavy metal parts, can be compressed into a small pack, and are as easy to assemble as buttoning your pants.

This hammock is so light and tiny when packed, you’ll feel weird not bringing one everywhere you go.
