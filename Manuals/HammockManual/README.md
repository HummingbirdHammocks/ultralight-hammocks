## CHECK

Look for signs of wear, damage, loose stitching, or discoloration. If you find anything that would indicate a potential failure, please contact us before using the hammock and we will provide advice on how to proceed.

Never exceed the maximum rated weight for each hammock or tree straps. These weight ratings exist to protect the equipment and the user, and are the maximum safe weight the hammock will hold. The maximum weight an entire system will hold is dictated by the weakest piece of equipment, for example if the tree straps are rated to 400 lbs and the hammock is rated to 300 lbs, the weight supported by the entire system must not exceed 300 lbs.

Ensure there are no sharp objects in your back pockets or on your pants, any small rocks or other debris in the hammock that may damage it. This is the most common reason for a failure.

## LOCATION

Look for a spot with two sturdy trees (or other objects to attach to) that are about 12 to 15 feet apart. Be sure the trees are thick enough and healthy enough to hang from, we recommend at least 8 inches in diameter. One of the major advantages of hammock camping is not having to worry about finding a clear and flat spot for a tent. However we still recommend not setting up over sharp rocks or at the edge of a cliff.

## STRAPS

Attach the webbing end of the tree straps to the trees by wrapping them around the trunk and passing the whoopie sling end of the strap through the small sewn webbing loop. Pull the extra slack out of the webbing loop created around the tree, and snug them up about 6 feet from the ground.

Adjustment to the whoopie sling must be done while there is no weight on the hammock or straps. To adjust the length of the whoopie slings so they are shorter, simply pull the single string extending from the finger trapped section with the single knot on the end. To extend the whoopie sling, hold onto the knot on the loop section just before the fingertrap section and then extend the loop by pulling gently on the opposing side of the loop. Holding the knot during this process relives strain on the fingertrap to allow movement and lengthening of the whoopie sling.

Adjust the whoopie slings out to allow enough length to attach the hammock, leave some extra slack at this point to make it easier to assemble.

## ATTACH

Remove hammock from stuff sack, drape it over your shoulder or around your neck to keep it off the ground. Ensure the Button Links are properly attached; the white spectra cord should be tied around the hammock fabric, not resting on itself. For further explanation, please refer to the Button Link Replacement Guide. Using the button links, attach the hammock to the tree straps one end at a time. Pass the button end of the button link through the large loop end of the whoopie sling on the tree strap. Now pass the button through the small loop on the button link just as you would a typical garment button. This locks the button link closed and securely attaches the hammock to the tree straps.

## TENSION

![Hammock Hang Tension](./assets/HammockHangLocation.png)
Adjust the whoopie slings, there will be some stretch when the hammock gets loaded with weight so make it a little tighter than the final intended hang angle. 30 degrees is typically considered an ideal hang angle, to achieve that angle we have found pulling the hammock so it hangs to an angle of 15 degrees before weight is added will ultimately be about right. You can determine 30 degrees by holding up your hand, thumb pointed to the sky and forefinger parallel to the horizon (pictured below). The angle from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your forefinger is approximately 30 degrees. Getting the right hang angle is trial and error and personal preference, have fun with it and see what works best for you!

## HANG

Check all components and connection points, ensure the tree straps are properly attached to the trees and the button links are correctly assembled. Carefully enter the hammock by sitting back into it like a chair, once the hammock is supporting weight check the hang angle again to be sure you are happy with it. Make any necessary adjustments or just lay back into the hammock and enjoy!

For sleeping or extended hammock sessions, we recommend laying in the hammock diagonally. This allows a flatter lie that is easier on the back, less prone to midnight wake ups and maximizes hammock surface area.

## UN-HANG

![Packing Instructions](./assets/PackingInstructionEndDrawing.png)

To exit the hammock turn so you are sitting in it like a chair again. Lean forward and place your feet on the ground, lean forward and stand up. Now disassemble your hammock by reversing the setup steps.

Pack the hammock back into it’s stuff sack. This is easily accomplished by holding the bag upside down by the opening and using your fingers to push the hammock back into the bag. Pack as much of the hammock into the bottom of the bag as you can, this will ensure there is enough space in bag to fit the hammock. Pinch the top of the stuff sack as you pull the drawstring, and use the cord lock to secure it closed.

## WARNING

Do not leave the hammock or tree straps in direct sunlight. The UV light will degrade and weaken the nylon material over time.
Avoid stepping on the hammock, letting it drag on the ground or abrading it in any other way. This will weaken and damage the fabric.
Do not use solvents or soaps to clean the hammock, warm or room temperature water will remove most dirt and stains. If soap is needed, only use a very small amount of a very gentle cleaner like Woolite. Do not wash a hammock in a washing machine, gentle hand-wash only.
Dry your hammock in the shade, out of direct sunlight.
Do not pack the hammock up wet, this may result in mildew forming on the fabric.
Be responsible when selecting trees to hang from, they should be at least 8 inches in diameter and healthy enough to support the weight.
If not using Hummingbird Hammocks Tree Straps, please do not use ropes or thin webbing as this may damage the trees.
Don’t pull the hammock too tight when adjusting your tree straps, not only will this reduce the comfort of the hammock, but will also put undue stress on the tree straps and hammock and may result in hammock failure.
Do not bounce in the hammock, bouncing puts unnecessary stress on the hammock and tree straps.
Never exceed the maximum weight rating of any piece of your gear.
Ensure there are no sharp objects that will come in contact with the hammock or tree straps, this includes sticks, knives, sharp buttons on your pants, sharp rocks, or excessive dirt in the hammock.
