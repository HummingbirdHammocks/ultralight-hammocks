Feed the new Button Link through the same channel. It does not matter which direction the Button Link goes through.

Create a new larks head knot by feeding the button at one end through the large loop at the other end.

With one hand, pull the gathered hammock fabric tight so that no excess fabric is tied with the spectra cord.

Now, pull the button end of the Button Link so that the larks head knot tightens around the hammock fabric. The knot will be more secure when you have put your weight in the hammock.

Your spectra cord should NOT be contacting itself. If your cord is not wrapped around the hammock fabric, the stitching of the fabric will wear out more quickly.

Please be sure your Button Link is properly connected before each use.
